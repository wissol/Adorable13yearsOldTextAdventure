                  or

  the Adorable 13 years old text adventure 

*********************************************

- Started: December 2018
- Status: Early development
- Being a programming exercise by Miguel de Luis Espinosa
- Intending to create a basic, simple, short IF Text Adventure in the 8-bit tradition
  (think Zork, Infocom...)
- What's in a name:
   a) "13 years old text adventure" refers to putting myself in the mood of just doing something simple that works and have no 
      concerns for great coding skills and a lot of important computing things that would get in the way of fun.
   b) "Adorable" was just part of a randomly generated repository name 

 Constraints
=============

  - The parser would understand up to three items: Verb + Predicate_1 + Predicate_2
  - Each of these items may be represented by one or, at most, 2 words 
  - No prepositions, articles, and whathaveyou 
  so "examine the red bear" should be understanded by the parser as Verb "examine" Predicate_1 "red bear"
  "examine the big red bear" would not work
